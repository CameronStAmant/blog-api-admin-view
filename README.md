This project is the admin frontend side of a blog. It was built with React and communicates with the node server via REST API. While similar to the client frontend side, this side allows admins to create, edit, and delete posts, as well as edit and delete comments. The user can publish and unpublish posts, which display and hide them on the clients side. Demos, credentials, and repos for both frontends and the backend can be found below:
